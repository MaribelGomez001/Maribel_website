		A photo of me with few of my favorite things, I chose a image of me, a character called Oikawa Tooru from "Haiykyuu," animal whiskers, and a halloween candy background to the few things that represent me. I love anime and Oikawa is one of my favorite character from "Haikyuu." Also I really like animals, all type of sweets, and Halloween is my favorite holiday.

		I used a lot of shapes and effects. The background color I chose was more of a getting-night color, like when the sunset is over and you get to see a bit of the stars. This represents be, in a way, because I personally like it at that hour more than a sunset view. I also like to wear more bold and dark colors than pastels. The most challenging part was starting off because I really didn't know what to draw, but when I let the creative flow, it was nice and fun.

	<h3 align="center">Audio Project</h3>
	<p>
		This audio sample is the sound of me interacting with my pet budgie, singing happily on a peaceful morning. When it comes to beautiful sounds, I think of my budgie (Maxwell) singing, and I decided to use calm and happy music in the background. This audio assignment consists of four audio samples. Although I had to duplicate one audio clip of my budgie toy shaking because the original audio was a bit short. I also fainted out the music towards the end when he finished singing.

	<h3 align="center">GIF Animation</h3>
	<p>
		What makes the animation funny is that everything appears innocent and cute until the candy falls down and spells out a different word. As I was thinking of what to do, I was thinking about using a rabbit but didn't know what to do with it at first, and I then thought of adding it to my website homepage as a greeting. I did everything in Illustrator and animated the rest in Photoshop.
